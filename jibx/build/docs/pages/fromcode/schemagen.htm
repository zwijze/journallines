      <h3><a name="intro"></a>Generating a schema from binding and code</h3>

<p>Schema generation from a binding and code uses the <code>org.jibx.schema.generator.SchemaGen</code>
class. The implementation has been heavily influenced by the needs of BindGen, and may not be
usable with bindings constucted by hand. If you want to give it a try, run SchemaGen directly
from a console and you'll receive a list of command line parameters. Future releases in the 1.2
series will improve SchemaGen handling of unusual binding constructs, and will also include
further documentation.</p>
