<p>Generating binding definitions and XML schema definitions from Java code is easy with
JiBX. The <a href="%bindgen%">BindGen</a> tool, added in the 1.2 release, allows you to use
both automatic and customized conversions for your Java classes. It provides a much better
feature set than any of the alternative ways to generate schema definitions from Java code,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Export JavaDocs as schema documentation</li>
<li>Support for both untyped and typed (Java 5) collection classes</li>
<li>Support for both custom typesafe enumerations and Java 5 enums</li>
<li>Easy control over attribute vs. element, required vs. optional</li>
<li>Clean schema structure, with customizations for fine-grained control</li>
</ul>

<p>For an in-depth look at using BindGen, see the
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/tutorials/j-jibx1/">JiBX 1.2,
Part 1: Java code to XML schema</a> tutorial on the
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks">IBM developerWorks site</a>. You can also
look over the BindGen examples included in the distribution, which are discussed in this
section of the documentation.</p>

<p>Besides generating schema definitions, you can also generate WSDL definitions from Java
code. This uses the <a href="%jibx2wsdl%">Jibx2Wsdl</a> tool. Jibx2Wsdl builds
on BindGen's features for generating data structure schemas, while adding equally-attractive
features for generating WSDL service descriptions.</p>

<p>This section of the documentation covers both BindGen and Jibx2Wsdl. It also includes
information on the associated <a href="%schemagen%">SchemaGen</a> tool, which is primarily
intended for use by BindGen and Jibx2Wsdl but can also be used directly.</p>
