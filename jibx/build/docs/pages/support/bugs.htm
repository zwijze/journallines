<p>There's a known inconsistency in the way certain
combinations of optional components are handled. This is not really a bug, but
rather an ambiguity in the way optional items are interpreted. It's likely to
remain until JiBX 2.0:</p>

<ul>
<li>Optional structures are not handled consistently unless they have an associated
property value. In other words, structures that just define a wrapper element
around some content that's part of a containing object won't always work as
expected if you make them optional. This creates problems in trying to wrap
text or CDATA values with elements to make them optional using binding constructs like:
<div id="source"><pre>&lt;structure name="wrapper" usage="optional">
  &lt;value style="cdata" field="m_rawText" usage="optional"/>
&lt;/structure></pre></div>
The result is that if the <b>m_rawText</b> field is <code>null</code> an empty
<b>&lt;wrapper></b> element will be generated when marshalling, which will then
be converted to an empty string value when unmarshalling. There is a work-around
for this, which is to use a <b>test-method</b> on the <b>structure</b>. The test
method can check if the field value is null, and if so return false.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you run into problems with the code please check existing bug reports for
information on fixes, and enter a new bug report if you don't find one matching
your problem. JiBX uses the <a
href="http://jira.codehaus.org/secure/BrowseProject.jspa?id=10410">Jira issue
tracking system</a> hosted by <a href="http://www.codehaus.org/">The
Codehaus</a>. Please note that JiBX is not otherwise affiliated with The
Codehaus, and other aspects of the project remain hosted on <a href="http://sf.net">
SourceForge</a>. You can browse the Jira bug list without restriction, but will
need to register in order to enter new issues.</p>

<p>You can help make sure your problem is addressed quickly and completely by
attaching sample code to demonstrate the problem. The sample code should be
packaged as a <i>zip</i> or <i>tar.gz</i> file, and should
include an Ant <i>build.xml</i> script to compile the code, run the binding
compiler, and (for runtime problems) execute a test of the binding. The
<i>starter</i> example included in the JiBX distribution shows how this can
work.</p>
