<p>The official mailing lists for the JiBX projects are hosted by SourceForge.
You must subscribe to the lists (which you can do through the SourceForge
project <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=69358">mailing list
page</a>) before you're allowed to post to them. If you just want to see what's
been discussed you can access searchable archives at the Mail Archive (<a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/jibx-users%40lists.sourceforge.net/">jibx-users</a>
and <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/jibx-devs%40lists.sourceforge.net/">jibx-devs</a>) and MARC: Mailing List Archives at AIMS
(<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=jibx-users&r=1&w=2">jibx-users</a>,
<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=jibx-devs&r=1&w=2">jibx-devs</a>, and
<a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=jibx-cvs&r=1&w=2">jibx-cvs</a>). If
you're new to JiBX it's a good idea to check the archives first before asking a
usage question, just in case it's already been discussed. You should also at
least look through the <a href="%tutorial%">Binding Tutorial</a> to make sure
your question isn't covered there.</p>

<p>Besides blocking postings from non-subscribers, the mailing lists also block
postings larger than 50KB in size. If you try posting to the list without
subscribing, or posting an email larger than 50KB, your email will be held by
SourceForge until a list administrator examines the email and decides what to
do (normally just sending them back to you with a rejection message). Tending to
blocked emails is not a priority item, so you're best off keeping these
restrictions in mind when posting to the list - and if your email doesn't show
up on the list within a day or so, double check the email size and that you're
still subscribed (SourceForge sometimes drops email addresses because of
problems such as bounced messages).</p>
