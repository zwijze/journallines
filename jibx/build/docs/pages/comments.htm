<p>Speed and accuracy are crucial to Travelocity - delays of even a few
seconds can mean lost customers and lost revenue. As XML has become an
increasingly important element of modern e-commerce, JiBX plays a key
role for parsing and handling critical flight, hotel and rental car
details each day.

<p>We have been using JiBX for several years in our production systems
for transfering critical data to our backend servers. JiBX allowed us
to embrace XML transparently: JiBX is very fast, low overhead, and its
binding definitions make it flexible. We liked so much its flexibility
that we have been using XML files and JiBX in a recent project instead
of a database for some specific data. And that choice saved us lots of
time for evolving the data through the development of the project.

<p>JiBX provides lightening quick mapping of data from xml to java classes and
vice versa.  Using JiBX-soap allowed us to reduce the communications overhead of
calling our web services down to a handful of milliseconds.

<p>The scenario I was confronted with was that persistence functionality based
on XML data output should be added to code already in heavy use. It only took a
quick glance on some tutorials of XML data binding frameworks to figure out that
JiBX was the choice for me. The decisive point clearly was flexibility and with
the JiBX binding framework I managed to add the required functionality with
minimum effort and only unsignificant changes to the existing code. The result
is a highly performant solution meeting the demands made on software used in a
scientific environment.

<p>I am impressed by the flexibility and responsiveness of a product in such
beginning stages. I have successfully incorporated JiBX with our Java based
object model and have been able to offer my users a more generic and efficient
xml binding framework and generation tool.

<p>When I was tasked with adding XML support to our project, I dreaded the
re-work required to get the two technologies to integrate. JiBX solved the
problem fast; not only was there no code changes required but JiBX reads and
writes XML faster than our normal save routines. Highly recommended for any
project using Java and XML.

<p>Sync4j, the open mobile application server, uses JiBX since it
combines production grade quality and performance with an easy
development integration process. It allows Sync4j to focus on
SyncML and I recommend projects with similar requirement to
use JiBX also.

<p>We use JiBX for converting Java Objects into XML Documents that are
then sent to a variety of web services in the telecommunications
industry. We wanted a technology that allowed us to make XML Code that
is correct to a schema and can be loaded to our objects; JiBX was the
best that we found. It's fast and surprisingly easy to use. We will
definitely be using JiBX technology in the future.
