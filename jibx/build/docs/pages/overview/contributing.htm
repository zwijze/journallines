      <h3><a name="intro"></a>Areas for extension</h3>

<p>The 1.2 release of JiBX is expected to be the last major release in the 1.X
series, though there will still be point releases of 1.2 for bug fixes. JiBX
2.0, featuring a rewritten code generator and improvements to the runtime
design, is in development but may not be available in usable form for some time.
The 2.0 work requires in-depth knowledge of the code and is not something where
new developers are likely to be able to become directly involved.</p>

<p>Even so, there are several areas where interested developers <i>can</i> make
important contributions to the JiBX project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clean up the Ant task code. This currently uses some deprecated Ant
methods, and doesn't support all the options you'd expect in terms of
structuring the file sets.</li>
<li>Build GUI Wizard front-ends for the various tools, including <a href="%bindgen%">BindGen</a>,
<a href="%jibx2wsdl%">Jibx2Wsdl</a>, and <a href="%codegen%">CodeGen</a>. These tools all allow
for extensive customizations in the form of XML files. A Wizard could initialize settings from
an existing configuration file, then save the file and pass it to the actual
tool for processing when the user is done making their choices.</li>
<li>Work on better integration for JiBX in Spring environments.</li>
<li>Add support for transforming JAXB 2.0 annotations into BindGen customizations, so that
developers using JAXB 2.0 can easily switch to JiBX.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're interested in working in any of these areas (or have your own ideas
for extending JiBX) check first on the <i>jibx-dev</i> email list to see if
anyone else is already working in the same area.</p>
