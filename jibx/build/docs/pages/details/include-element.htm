      <h3><a name="intro">&lt;include&gt; Element Definition</a></h3>
      
<p>The <b>include</b> element allows modular binding definitions by specifying
another binding to be read as part of the current binding definition. Since 1.2, it
also allows for bindings to be separately compiled.</p>

<p>Top-level <b>format</b> and <b>mapping</b> definitions from the included
binding are treated the same as if they'd been present in the original binding,
as children of the <b>binding</b> element. <b>namespace</b> definitions, on the
other hand, apply downward only: Top-level <b>namespace</b> definitions in the
original binding apply to the included binding just as if they were directly
present, but namespace definitions within the included binding do not apply back
to the original binding. This makes it easy to structure bindings corresponding
to different namespaces, and to combine these bindings without namespace
conflicts.</p>

<p><b>include</b> elements can also be used within included
bindings, and circular references are allowed.</p>

<p>The <b>include</b> element defines two unique attributes.</p>

<h4><a name="Attributes">Attributes</a></h4>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="100%">
<tr class="b">
<td>path</td>
<td><p>The path for the binding definition to be included. This may be an
absolute path, or a path relative to the including binding definition. Any type
of URL reference can be used for the path, including <b>classpath:</b> URLs to access
bindings from the classpath (especially useful when working with modular bindings).
If you're using file paths on Windows
and want to specify the absolute path (such as <i>C:/some/directory/file.xml</i>)
you'll need to convert this into a valid URL reference by using either '/' or
'file:///' as a prefix (so <i>/C:/some/directory/file.xml</i> or
<i>file:///C:/some/directory/file.xml</i>).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>precompiled</td>
<td><p>Flag used when including a precompiled binding. If the value is "true", the
included binding must have been compiled previously and the classes used by that binding
(including the extra classes generated by the binding compiler) must be present in the
classpath. See the full discussion of <a href="%precompiled%">precompiled bindings</a>
for details.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Attributes of the included <b>binding</b> element generally must match the same
attributes of the original binding; the only exceptions are the <b>package</b> and
<b>name</b> attributes.</p>
