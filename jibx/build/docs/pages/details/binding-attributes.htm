      <h3><a name="elements">Attribute Groups</a></h3>

<pThese are the groups of attribute values that are shared between
different element types:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#style">style</a> - controls simple value style (as attribute or
element)</li>
<li><a href="#name">name</a> - defines XML attribute or element name</li>
<li><a href="#object">object</a> - provides options for Java object handling</li>
<li><a href="#property">property</a> - controls how a value is accessed from a
Java object</li>
<li><a href="#structure">structure</a> - define ordering and reuse of lists of
child binding components</li>
<li><a href="#string">string</a> - define conversions between Java property
values and text representations</li>
</ul>
<p>All these attributes are optional unless stated otherwise.</p>

<h4><a name="style">style</a></h4>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="100%">
<tr class="b">
<td>value-style</td>
<td><p>Defines the binding style for simple values. The allowed values are
&quot;element&quot; (values as child elements with only text content) or
&quot;attribute&quot; (values as attributes).</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="name">name</a></h4>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="100%">
<tr class="b">
<td>name</td>
<td><p>Local (unqualified) name of element or attribute.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>ns</td>
<td><p>Gives the namespace URI for the element or attribute name. If this is
not used the default value is the innermost default namespace for this type,
if any.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="object">object</a></h4>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="100%">
<tr class="b">
<td>create-type</td>
<td><p>Gives the type to be used when creating instances of the object during
unmarshalling. This gives an alternative to the <b>factory</b> attribute when
all you want to do is use a specific implementation for an interface or an
abstract class.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>factory</td>
<td><p>Defines a factory method for constructing new instances of an object
type. This applies to bindings for unmarshalling only, and if supplied it must
be in the form of a fully-qualified class and method name (e.g.,
&quot;com.sosnoski.jibx.ObjectBuilderFactory.newInstance&quot; specifies
the newInstance() method of the ObjectBuilderFactory class in the
com.sosnoski.jibx package) for a static method returning
an instance of the bound class. As with the other methods in this group
(<b>pre-set</b>, <b>post-set</b>, and <b>pre-get</b>), three different method
signatures are allowed: No arguments; a single argument of type
<code>java.lang.Object</code>, in which case the owning object is passed in the
method call; or a single argument of type
<code>org.jibx.runtime.IUnmarshallingContext</code>, in which case the
unmarshalling context is passed in the method call (this allows access to the
entire stack of objects being unmarshalled). If not supplied, instances of the
bound class are constructed using a null argument constructor.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="b">
<td>marshaller</td>
<td><p>Defines a custom serialization handler class, as the fully-qualified
name of a class implementing the <code>org.jibx.runtime.Marshaller</code>
interface. This is only allowed with an output binding; it is required if an
unmarshaller is defined for an input-output binding.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>nillable</td>
<td><p>Allows the W3C XML Schema attribute <b>xsi:nil="true"</b> to be used on
an element in instance documents to indicate that the corresponding object is
<code>null</code>. The default value is "false", set this attribute "true" to
enable <b>xsi:nil</b> support. The marshalling behavior when the attribute is
"true" and the object reference is <code>null</code> depends on whether the
binding defines the corresponding element as optional or required. If the
element is optional it will simply be left out of the marshalled document. If
the element is required it will be written with an <b>xsi:nil="true"</b>
attribute. This attribute can only be used with objects that are bound to an
element name.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="b">
<td>post-set</td>
<td><p>Defines a bound class method called on instances of the class after
they are populated with data from unmarshalling. This can be used for any
postprocessing or validation required by the class. Three different method
signatures are supported, as described in the <b>factory</b> attribute
text.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>pre-get</td>
<td><p>Defines a bound class method called on new instances of the class before
they are marshalled. This can be used for any preprocessing or validation
required by the class. Three different method signatures are supported, as
described in the <b>factory</b> attribute text.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="b">
<td>pre-set</td>
<td><p>Defines a bound class method called on new instances of the class before
they are populated with data from unmarshalling. This can be used for any
initialization or special handling required before a constructed instance is
used. Three different method signatures are supported, as described in the
<b>factory</b> attribute text.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>unmarshaller</td>
<td><p>Defines a custom deserialization handler class, as the fully-qualified
name of a class implementing the <code>org.jibx.runtime.Unmarshaller</code>
interface. This attribute cannot be used in combination with the <b>factory</b>,
or <b>pre-set</b> attributes. It is only allowed with an input binding; it is
required if a marshaller is defined for an input-output binding.</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="property">property</a></h4>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="100%">
<tr class="b">
<td>field</td>
<td><p>Gives the name of the field within the containing class that supplies the
property value. This is required except for auto-generated identity fields, for
values from a collection, or when both <b>get-method</b> (for output bindings)
and <b>set-method</b> (for input bindings) definitions are supplied.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>flag-method</td>
<td><p>Defines a method to be called by JiBX to indicate the presence or absence
of the associated element (or attribute, though this is mainly useful with elements).
This is the name of a method taking a <code>boolean</code> parameter, which will be
called with the value <code>true</code> if the element is present or the value
<code>false</code> if it is not present. This can be used in combination with the
<b>test-method</b> attribute to implement a presence flag for an optional element
which can be used even if the content of the element is ignored (by using an empty
<b>structure</b> definition).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="b">
<td>get-method</td>
<td><p>Defines a &quot;get&quot; method for retrieving the property value from
an instance of the containing class. This is the name of a no-argument method
returning a value (primitive or object). If a <b>get-method</b> is defined for
an object value represented by some form of structure in the binding (not just a
simple <b>value</b>, in other words), the method will be used to retrieve the
current instance of an object when unmarshalling. This follows the principle of
JiBX reusing existing objects for unmarshalled data where possible. If you
return a <code>null</code> value during unmarshalling, JiBX will create a new
instance of the object for unmarshalled data.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>set-method</td>
<td><p>Defines a &quot;set&quot; method for storing the property value in
an instance of the containing class. This is the name of a method with return
type <code>void</code>, taking a single value (primitive or object) as a
parameter. If both <b>get-method</b> and <b>set-method</b> are defined, the
<b>set-method</b> parameter type must be the same as the <b>get-method</b>
return value.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="b">
<td>test-method</td>
<td><p>Defines a method for checking if an optional property is present in an
instance of the containing class. This is the name of a no-argument method with
return type <code>boolean</code>, which must return <code>true</code> if the
property is present and <code>false</code> if it is not present. This is only
allowed in combination with <b>usage=&quot;optional&quot;</b>. If not specified,
a simple <code>==</code> comparison is used with primitive types to check for a
value different from the default, and a <code>equals()</code> comparison for
object types with non-null defaults</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>type</td>
<td><p>Supplies the fully-qualified class name for the property value. This can
be used to force a more specific type for a property value defined by the field
definition or access method signature as either a base class or an interface.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="b">
<td>usage</td>
<td><p>Defines the usage requirement for this property. The value can either be
&quot;required&quot; (property is always present, the default if not specified) or
&quot;optional&quot; (property is optional).</p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="structure">structure</a></h4>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="100%">
<tr class="b">
<td>allow-repeats</td>
<td><p>Determines whether repeated elements within an unordered group should be
allowed. The default is "false", meaning that if a bound element is repeated the
runtime code will throw an exception. Setting this "true" means repeated
elements will be processed the same as in pre-1.1 versions of JiBX. A "true"
value for this attribute is only allowed when all child definitions are elements
(no attributes or text), and requires <b>ordered="false"</b>. It cannot be used
in combination with <b>choice="true"</b>. This attribute is ignored on a
<b>collection</b> element.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>choice</td>
<td><p>Defines whether child binding definitions represent a choice between
alternatives, with only one allowed (value "true") or a set of possibilities of
which one or more may be present ("false", the default). A "true" value for this
attribute is only allowed when all child definitions are elements (no attributes
or text), and requires <b>ordered="false"</b>. It cannot be used in combination
with <b>allow-repeats="true"</b> or <b>flexible="true"</b>. This attribute is
ignored on a <b>collection</b> element.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="b">
<td>flexible</td>
<td><p>Defines whether unknown elements within an unordered group should be
ignored. The default is "false", meaning that if an unknown element (one not
allowed by the binding) is found during unmarshalling the runtime code will
throw an exception. Setting this "true" means unknown elements will be ignored
(along with all their content). A "true" value for this attribute is only
allowed when all child definitions are elements (no attributes or text), and
requires <b>ordered="false"</b>. It cannot be used in combination with
<b>choice="true"</b>. This attribute is ignored on a <b>collection</b>
element.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>label</td>
<td><p>Gives a label allowing the list of child components to be referenced
from elsewhere in the binding definition. <b>Note that this technique has been
deprecated, and will not be supported in JiBX 2.0. In most cases an abstract
mapping can be used as a replacement.</b></p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="b">
<td>ordered</td>
<td><p>Defines whether child binding definitions represent an ordered list
(value "true", the default) or an unordered set ("false"). When this is set
"true", each child <b>value</b> component must define either an element or an
attribute name (attributes are always unordered, so the <b>ordered</b> setting
of the grouping has no effect on attributes). <b>value</b> elements defining
text values (<b>style="text"</b>) are not allowed as direct children of groups
with <b>ordered="false"</b>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>using</td>
<td><p>References a list of child components defined elsewhere in the binding
definition. The value must match the <b>label</b> value used on a <b>mapping</b>,
<b>structure</b>, or <b>collection</b> element somewhere in the binding
definition. The child binding components of the referenced element are used as
the content of the element making the reference. The object types associated with the binding definition element making
the reference and that defining the reference must match, and the <b>order</b>
established by the element that defined the reference determines whether the
child definitions are considered as ordered or unordered. The element with this attribute must not have
any child definitions. <b>Note that this technique has been
deprecated, and will not be supported in JiBX 2.0. In most cases an abstract
mapping can be used as a replacement.</b></p></td>
</tr>
</table>

<h4><a name="string">string</a></h4>
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="2" border="1" width="100%">
<tr class="b">
<td>default</td>
<td><p>Gives the default value for a conversion. This is only allowed for
optional properties. If not specified, the default for primitive types is the
same as the member variable initial state defined by the JLS, and for object
types is &quot;null&quot;.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>enum-value-method</td>
<td><p>Specifies a method to be used to obtain the XML text representation for a
Java 5 enum class. If specified, this value method is used for both marshalling
and unmarshalling instances of the enum class (in the unmarshalling case, by
checking each instance of the enum in turn until one is found matching the input
text). If not specified, the <code>toString()</code> method of the enum class is
instead used for marshalling, and the static <code>valueOf</code> enum method is
used for unmarshalling, both of which use the enum value name directly.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="b">
<td>deserializer</td>
<td><p>Defines a custom deserialization handler method, as the fully-qualified
name of a static method with the signature <code>Target xxxx(String text)</code>,
where <code>xxxx</code> is the method name and <code>Target</code> is the type
of the property (primitive or object type). Note that when a custom
deserialization handler method is used for an optional object type with no
default value, that method will be called with a <code>null</code> argument
when the corresponding value is missing in the input document. It's up to the
handler method to handle this case appropriately (by returning either a
<code>null</code> or an object of the expected type).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="a">
<td>serializer</td>
<td><p>Defines a custom serialization handler method, as the fully-qualified
name of a static method with the signature <code>String xxxx(Target value)</code>,
where <code>xxxx</code> is the method name and <code>Target</code> is the type
of the property (primitive or object type).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="b">
<td>whitespace</td>
<td><p>Selects how whitespace will be handled when deserializing values. This
optional attribute can have the values: "preserve", meaning all text is processed
just as provided by the parser; "replace", meaning all tab, newline, and carriage
return characters in the text are replaced by space characters before the text is
processed; "collapse", meaning that after "replace" processing is done all
leading and trailing space characters are eliminated and all embedded sequences
of multiple spaces are replaced by single spaces; or "trim", meaning that after
"replace" processing is done all leading and trailing space characters are
eliminated.</p></td>
