<p>A <b>binding definition</b> is an XML document that defines the rules for
converting your Java objects to and from XML. The JiBX binding compiler takes
one or more binding definitions as input, along with your actual class files.
It compiles the binding definitions into Java byte code that it adds to
the class files. Once the class files have been enhanced with this compiled
binding definition code, they're ready to work with the JiBX runtime.</p>

<p>You can provide as many binding definitions as you want for the same set
of classes (or for different classes). The binding compiler automatically
generates code for all the bindings you provide. It even reuses added code
between bindings, whereever possible. However, each time you marshal or
unmarshal an XML document you'll first need to decide
which particular binding you're going to use for this document. Each binding
is independent of the others, so you can't switch between bindings within a
single document.</p>
